# Selenium WebDriver Classes

This repository contains three Java classes that demonstrate how to handle alerts, frames, and windows/tabs using Selenium WebDriver. These classes provide methods and examples to perform various operations related to alerts, frames, and windows in web applications.

## Classes

1. **AlertHandler**: This class demonstrates how to handle alerts using Selenium WebDriver. It provides methods to accept, dismiss, get text from, and send text to an alert.

2. **FrameHandler**: This class showcases how to handle frames (both regular frames and nested frames) using Selenium WebDriver. It includes methods to switch to frames by ID, index, or element, switch to the parent frame, and switch to the default content.

3. **WindowHandler**: This class illustrates how to handle browser windows/tabs using Selenium WebDriver. It provides methods to open new windows/tabs, switch to a specific window/tab, close the current window/tab, and switch back to the main window.

## Prerequisites

To run these classes, you need to have the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
